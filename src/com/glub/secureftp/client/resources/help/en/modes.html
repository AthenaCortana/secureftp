<h2>Transfer Modes</h2>

There are three modes of data transfers: auto, binary and text (ASCII).
Files are handled differently when it's a plain text document versus all
the other file types.

<br><br>

When <i>text</i> is set as the transfer mode, the server may change the
line endings of the file. That is, return characters may be replaced
with your system's return character. This allows for properly formatted text 
files.

<br><br>

However, bad things can happen if you apply a text mode to binary files
(such as Word documents). Here you would want the server to not
interpret anything in the file and just send it as is.

<br><br>

If you don't want to have to change between transfer modes, it's best to
set the mode to <i>auto</i> and let Secure FTP decide which is best.
