<a name="ssl"></a> <h2>What Is SSL?</h2>

SSL, or <i>Secure Sockets Layer,</i> is a secure technology designed by
Netscape Communications to enable encrypted, authenticated
communication. SSL is most visibly used in communication between Web
browsers and Web servers (where URLs that begin with <i>https</i>
indicate an SSL connection will be used).

<br><br>

Secure FTP extends this same technology to allow the transferring of
files over a secure connection (provided the FTP server supports SSL
connections).

<a name="support"></a> <h2>What Is Supported?</h2>

Secure FTP offers two SSL connection options: implicit and explicit
connections.

<a name="implicit"></a> <h3>Implicit SSL</h3>

Implicit security (also known as passive security), starts with an SSL
connection as soon as the connection is made. With implicit security,
the server defines a different port for the FTP client (usually port
990) to be used for the secure connection. Note: Implicit SSL was
initially defined in various FTPS drafts but is no longer recommended.

<a name="explicit"></a> <h3>Explicit SSL</h3>

Explicit security (also known as active security), starts with a basic
FTP connection (insecure) where a special command, <i>AUTH SSL,</i>
tells the server to transition into a secure mode. The specification is
formally defined in RFC 2228.

<a name="client"></a> <h3>Client Certificates</h3>

An additional way to authenticate a client to a server is to use SSL
client authentication. This form of authentication does not occur during
the login, but instead when the initial secure connection is made.

<br><br>

Secure FTP offers two ways to set and send a client certificate:

<ol> <li>Generate a self-signed certificate. This certificate can be
generated by answering a few simple questions, and is good for 3
years.<p> <li>Use an issued key/certificate pair from an administrator.
If your company has it's own Certificate of Authority, you can import
the private key and public certificate into the client. The private key
needs to be either in a PKCS#12 keystore, or alone in the PKCS#8 format.
The public/CA certificates needs to be either in a PKCS#12 keystore, or
alone in the PEM or DER formats.<p> <li>If the certificate/key pair is
protected by a passphrase, enter that passphrase in the appropriate
field. </ol>

These options can be found under the <i>Help &gt; Manage
Certificates</i> menu item.
