<a name="dir_list"></a> <h2>Transferring Data</h2>

Most likely this is the main purpose for using Secure FTP. There are
three types of data transfers: uploads, downloads and directory
listings.

<h3>Directory Listing</h3>

Directory listings are usually done implicitly. That is, when you change
directories an attempt to list the folder is done. You can, however,
force a directory listing by hitting the <img src="images/refresh.png">
<i>refresh</i> button, which can be found on the toolbar.

<a name="download"></a> <h3>Download</h3>

To perform a download implies that you are bringing a file from someone
else's machine <i>down</i> to your machine. There are few ways you can
do this. The easiest option would be to select all of the files you are
interested in and hit the <img src="images/download.png"> download
button (found on the toolbar). This will download the selected files
into your current directory (which can be found on the left side of the
window).

<br><br>

Optionally, you can choose to drag your selected files from the remote
side (the right) and drop them on the local side (the left). If you drag
over a local folder, that item will become highlighted, signaling that
the downloaded files will be stored there (instead of the current
directory).

<a name="upload"></a> <h3>Upload</h3>

To perform an upload implies that you are transferring a file from your
machine <i>up</i> to someone else's machine. There are a few ways you
can do this. The easiest option would be to select all of the files you
want to transfer and hit the <img src="images/upload.png"> upload button
(found on the toolbar). This will upload the selected files into the
current remote directory (shown on the right side of the window).

<br><br>

Likewise, you can drag your selected files from the local side (the
left) and drop them on the remote side (the right). If you drag over a
remote folder, that item will become highlighted, signaling that the
uploaded files will be stored there (instead of the current remote
directory). You can also drag files from your file system (e.g. your
desktop) into the remote side to accomplish the same task.
