<h2>How To Connect Via The Open Connection Dialog</h2>

Connecting to a server is a pretty straightforward process. At the bare
minimum, you will need to know some basic information, including the
host name, user name and password.

<br><br>

The <i>host name</i> is the name of the machine you wish to connect. The
<i>user name</i> is the name you would use to log in to that machine.
The <i>password</i> is the key that allows your user name in. In some
cases you may log in <i>anonymously,</i> in which case you may have less
privileges than a standard user.

<br><br>

By default, we will attempt to make an <a
href="security.html#ssl">explicit SSL</a> connection. If this connection
fails, we will notify you and offer to make an insecure connection.
<font color="red">Note:</font> You should choose this option carefully.
If you allow for this, your password and data are open to the public.

<br><br>

In the Open Connection dialog you can also specify a starting
<i>remote</i> folder and <i>local</i> folder, which the program will
navigate to upon successful login.

<br><br>

You can also set the <i>connection type.</i> The default is a
<i>passive</i> connection type, which for most users will be sufficient.
What this means is when a data transfer is made, the server will decide
where you will connect to. If you are behind a <a
href="faq.html#nat">NAT</a> firewall, you will want this option selected
or, if the server supports it and an <a
href="security.html#ssl">explicit SSL</a> connection is made, select the
<a href="#ccc">Clear Command Channel</a> option and the passive option
deselected.

<br><br>

<a name="ccc"></a> The <i>Clear Command Channel</i> option is available
only when an <a href="security.html#ssl">explicit SSL</a> connection is
made. After the user has been securely authenticated, the command (or
control) channel is reverted back to a clear connection. This option
allows users behind a (<a href="faq.html#nat">NAT</a>) firewall the
ability to get active (or PORT) data connections to work.

<br><br>

If you save these options to your bookmarks you can access them via the
Bookmarks menu or the Profile option in the Open Connection dialog. You
can get more information about bookmarks <a
