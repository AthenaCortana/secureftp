<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Can I restore deleted files?</h3>

In short, no. When deleting files from the remote server, there is no
<i>trashcan</i> or <i>recycle bin,</i> so files are deleted immediately.
Locally, your system might support restoring files, but since Secure FTP
is platform independent there is no way we can provide such
functionality.

<h3>Support for NAT</h3>

NAT, or <i>Network Address Translation,</i> is becoming more frequently
used. If you are using a firewall or other device that gives you many
IPs from one, chances are you are using NAT. The only thing you need to
watch when using NAT and Secure FTP is when you are <b>not</b> using a
<a href="connection.html">passive</a> connection type. If you are behind
NAT and are making a secure connection, you will need to make either: a
passive connection, or enable the <a href="connection.html#ccc">Clear
Command Channel</a> option along with an active (PORT) data connection,
otherwise your <a href="transfer.html">data transfers</a> will fail.
This is because during an insecure FTP connection your NAT device
actually listens for FTP commands and does the correct address routing.
But when the connection is secure, the NAT device cannot peek in and do
the right thing. When making passive connections, NAT will not have to
worry about this behavior.
