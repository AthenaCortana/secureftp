Instructions on how to translate Secure FTP:

Note: all files should be saved in UTF-8 format and as plain text (.txt/.html).

--

strings.properties:

This file represents all of the text that appears in the client. Each line
has two parts, the part to the left of the equal sign ("=") and the part
to the right.

The left side should _not_ be translated (it is the key). The right side
_should_ be translated.

For example:

Menu.file=File

The left side, Menu.file, is the "File" menu and displays the text "File".
You should translate "File" into the appropriate language.

A mnemonic is a character that will be used as a keyboard shortcut. In the
case of "File" the mnemonic chosen is "F". This will allow Alt+F. If your
translation doesn't have this character, you should use your best judgement
to find a replacement character. It is important that within a menu, only
one mnemonic is used.


Wildcards:

In some cases there are areas within some text where additional text will be
placed during the running of the program. These areas are called wildcards.
A wildcard looks like this:

  [^#]

where "#" is a number.

It is important that these values stay the same. They can be moved around
in the sentence to make sense.

For example:

  Connection failed: [^0]

At run time you would see this as:

  Conection failed: the server could not be reached.

The text "the server could not be reached." would replace the value at [^0]


Quoted words:

A word that is quoted looks like this:

  \"This word is quoted\"

So, places where you would use a quotation mark should look like \"

SecureFTP.hs:

This file is responsible for the main help navigation tree. The only items
that need translating are the text between:

  <title>[translate this stuff]</title>
  <label>[translate this stuff]</label>


==

SecureFTPIndex.xml:

This file contains the terms that show up in the help's index panel. The only
items that need translating are:

  <indexitem text="[translate this stuff]"


==

SecureFTPTOC.xml:

This file contains the items that show up in the table of contents. The only
items that need translating are:

  <tocitem text="[translate this stuff]"


==

The files ending in .html:

This is the bulk of the help content. All of the non-HTML tags need to be
translated. If you are unsure what is an HTML tag, please email me so we can
discuss it further.
