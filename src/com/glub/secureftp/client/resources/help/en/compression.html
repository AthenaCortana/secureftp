<h2>Mode Z Compression</h2>

Mode Z technology is an on-the-fly data compression mechanism that
allows for significantly faster data transfers (especially those that
are text based).

<br><br>

Some files can be compressed at a very high ratio (such as HTML
documents and log files), and directory listings are additionally done
about 3-4 times faster than without this technology.

<br><br>

By default, Secure FTP attempts to enable this mechanism (which can
be disabled in the Preferences), but its success is determined by the
remote server (since not all servers support this technology).
